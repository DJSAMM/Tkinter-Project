# Tkinter-Project
Tkinter Project for Intro to Software Development

Updated Readme. In the newest version of the project I have pretty much ironed out all of the apps mechanics. 
Once app is ran user is prompted with four different text boxes all labeled for the specific statistic they are supposed to keep. 
Once these stats are entered press the enter button, this then takes the user to the second page, which lists the stats previously enterd.
This second list page in addition to keeping track of the stats also has an exit button for when the user is done, or a second option which allows the user to input another rounds stats.
